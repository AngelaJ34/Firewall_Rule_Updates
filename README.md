Microsoft Windows Defender Firewall IP Update List

Block/blacklist Malicious Ip Addresses in Windows Defender using a Python script that automatically blocks newly seen IP addresses.

# Overview of Windows Defender Firewall
What Windows Defender Firewall is doing is blocking both inbound and outbound traffic into our network.
So what the firewall does is it will either allow or deny the incoming requests from a specific destination Ip address to prevent malicious IP addresses from sending or receiving a connection from the source IP address.
